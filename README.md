## Rationale

Cyber Security spending is an indication of the overall security of an organisation and how seriously they take security. The freedom of information requests sent during this project initially target areas of Government, agencies and public bodies whose security can be considered of national importance, and lack of security could be considered a risk to national security. Later, other departments, agencies and bodies will be added to this list.

With states exploring new ways to project their power, protect and enhance their national interests using Cyber; hybrid warfare, the "grey zone" and disruption. The security of Government and Public Bodies providing critical services is paramount. 

This is, of course, complex. Public services, such as Ambulance, Police and Fire Services are deciding between protecting people and protecting their infrastructure. This becomes a larger Government issue where national projects, standards, guidelines and ultimately money needs to be provisioned to provide an appropriate level of security nation-wide.

This data can be used to encourage the improvement of cyber security and the overall resilience of the UK.

## The FOI Request

Each Department, Agency or Non-Governmental Body was asked to provide the same information (see [appendix](#appendix) for full text):

1. Provide the total amount of money spent on Cyber Security for financial years 2015-18.
2. The term "Cyber Security" is defined as: "... consider the term to encompass activities relating to information security, computer security and computer network security. Including staff training, consultant services, software and hardware." 
3. Additionaly, "Details on what training and consultant services were for ..."

At the time of the request (December 2018) 1. would provide approximately three years of data.

#### Notes on National and Regional Ambulance Services Responses

__London Ambulance Service__ withheld the requested informaiton under the following two exemptions:

* _s.21 Information reasonably accessible to the applicant by other means._ This refers to their annual accounts in which they break down their annual budget. However, this does not include all of the information requested, it contains data related to the broad category of IT. Additionally, this only includes expenditure over £25,000.

* _s.43(2) Prejudice to commercial interests "in respect to information on expenditure within the categories you have highlighted and that is not already publicly available, we have carried out the public interest test and have concluded that disclosure of this information could prejudice the commercial interests of the Trust and, therefore, that the public interest in withholding this information outweighs the public interest in disclosure."_

In line with legislation an internal review will be requested of LBS to gain access to the requested informaiton. I believe this informaiton is in the public interest - to ensure LBS are taking cyber security seriously and compare expenditure to other ambulance services. Additionally, in my view revealing the expenditure on broad categories of cyber security spending does not damage the trusts commerical interests as no additional information or details are being requested.

## The Use of GitHub

GitHub is designed for software version control. Apart from its distributed nature allowing collaberation and redundancy, a main feature is the ability to log and view changes between additions (commits) and attribute them to a user. As a result GitHub, and other public distributed version control repositories are ideal for creating and storing datasets such as this one. Users can view every change from the projects creation. Commented and used well by the creator, the reason for each change is recorded.

Additionally, the use of GPG Keys can confirm the ID of the user committing changes to a repository.

__To view the commit history click the number of [commits](https://github.com/krisbolton/UK-Cyber-Security-Spending-Data/commits/master) listed on the main repository page__
