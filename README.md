## Rationale

Cyber Security spending is an indication of the overall security of an organisation and how seriously they take security. The freedom of information requests sent during this project initially target areas of Government, agencies and public bodies whose security can be considered of national importance, and lack of security could be considered a risk to national security. Later, other departments, agencies and bodies will be added to this list.

With states exploring new ways to project their power, protect and enhance their national interests using Cyber; hybrid warfare, the "grey zone" and disruption. The security of Government and Public Bodies providing critical services is paramount. 

This is, of course, complex. Public services, such as Ambulance, Police and Fire Services are deciding between protecting people and protecting their infrastructure. This becomes a larger Government issue where national projects, standards, guidelines and ultimately money needs to be provisioned to provide an appropriate level of security nation-wide.

This data can be used to encourage the improvement of cyber security and the overall resilience of the UK.

## The FOI Request

Each Department, Agency or Non-Governmental Body was asked to provide the same information (see [appendix](#appendix) for full text):

1. Provide the total amount of money spent on Cyber Security for financial years 2015-18.
2. The term "Cyber Security" is defined as: "... consider the term to encompass activities relating to information security, computer security and computer network security. Including staff training, consultant services, software and hardware." 
3. Additionaly, "Details on what training and consultant services were for ..."

At the time of the request (December 2018) 1. would provide three and a half years of data.

## The Use of GitHub

GitHub is designed for software version control. Apart from its distributed nature allowing collaberation and redundancy, a main feature is the ability to log and view changes between additions (commits) and attribute them to a user. As a result GitHub, and other public distributed version control repositories are ideal for creating and storing datasets such as this one. Users can view every change from the projects creation. Commented and used well by the creator, the reason for each change is recorded.

Additionally, the use of GPG Keys can confirm the ID of the user committing changes to a repository.
